## Software Specifications
|Backend|Frontend|
|:---|:---|
|Django (Python)|HTML|
MySQL(Database)|CSS|
|   |JS|

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability and reliability is taken care by django, as it is simple, highly scalable and flexible.
- Security of the sensitive data transmission of users is taken care by django.
- We designed the database with high data integrity.
- The performance of the application will be good with the optimised queries in MySQL.
- Maintainability and Manageability of the application will be good, as we are following the best Software principles.
- MySQL is capable enough to scale the project to even higher.
- The portability of the application is high, as we are using one of the most popular framework.


## Objectives of Software Engineering: 

1. Maintainability – We are following best software engineering practices. So, it is feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.
2. Efficiency – The software should not make wasteful use of computing devices such as memory, processor cycles, etc.
3. Correctness – A software product is correct if the different requirements as specified in the SRS document have been correctly implemented.
4. Reusability – A software product has good reusability if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.
5. Testability – Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria.
6. Reliability – It is an attribute of software quality. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function, over an arbitrary time period.
7. Portability – In this case, the software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.
8. Adaptability – In this case, the software allows differing system constraints and the user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software.
9. Interoperability – Capability of 2 or more functional units to process data cooperatively.
