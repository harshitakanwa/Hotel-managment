## Project Description
* The purpose of the proposed system is to provide uncomplicated, trouble-free environment to the respective users.                                              
* It reduces the manual work being done in the current system.
* Make functionalities more error-free and explicit.          
* Make information more precise and reliable.
* As the project name suggests hotel management in which it makes the work of users a lot easier and experience of user a lot simpler.
* This has some new features like like  Advance Booking , and feedback of experience etc.
* We can also track history of Hotel customers
* It makes hotel user and management work very simpler and easier.

## Software Specifications
|Backend|Frontend|
|:---|:---|
|Django (Python)|HTML|
PostgreSQL(Database)|CSS|
|   |JS|

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability and reliability is taken care by django, as it is simple, highly scalable and flexible.
- Security of the sensitive data transmission of users is taken care by django.
- We designed the database with high data integrity.
- The performance of the application will be good with the optimised queries in PostgresSQL.
- Maintainability and Manageability of the application will be good, as we are following the best Software principles.
- PostgreSQL is capable enough to scale the project to even higher.
- The portability of the application is high, as we are using one of the most popular framework.


## Objectives of Software Engineering: 

1. Maintainability – We are following best software engineering practices. So, it is feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.
2. Efficiency – The software should not make wasteful use of computing devices such as memory, processor cycles, etc.
3. Correctness – A software product is correct if the different requirements as specified in the SRS document have been correctly implemented.
4. Reusability – A software product has good reusability if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.
5. Testability – Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software with respect to those criteria.
6. Reliability – It is an attribute of software quality. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function, over an arbitrary time period.
7. Portability – In this case, the software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.
8. Adaptability – In this case, the software allows differing system constraints and the user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software.
9. Interoperability – Capability of 2 or more functional units to process data cooperatively.
